Here is the process of how Antdao work:
1. Get address of your wallet
2. Generate a pair of P256 keys and save it in keychain
3. Sign a message with you wallet(should be pair with the address in step 1) and get the signature
4. You can get right format message:
val AntdaoInstance = Antdao(WALLETADDRESS) //in step 1
val message = AntdaoInstance.getAuthorizeString() //use the pubkey of the pairs in step 2
5. Sign this message with your wallet and get signature
val signature = signature //from step 3
AntdaoInstance.registerKey(signature: signature, network: .eth) { data in
    print(data) 
}

6. Now you can use AntdaoInstance to create your own connection with other people in web3.0 world if you get success feedback in step 5
